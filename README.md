AGC is a collection of example applications of Control Rigs in Unreal Engine 4.
These include:
- Custom animation ("hanging from ledge") created with the in-editor sequencer.
- Inverse kinematics for leg placement on uneven ground/stairs
- Inverse kinematics for placing the character's hand on nearby objects.
- Procedural crouching, which modifies the current animation state of the character.
- Head/upper body tracking from the character's camera direction.

The program was developed and tested on Unreal Engine 4.27.
